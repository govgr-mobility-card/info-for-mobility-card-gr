# info-for-mobility-card-gr
info-for-mobility-card-gr is a web-based dialog system that covers the information stage of the public service of the Mobility Card for people with disabilities. This system includes two main functions, a questionnaire and a number of questions (with their answers) that are frequently asked by citizens about this service, known as FAQs. It was created in order to inform citizens whether or not they are eligible for the issuance of a Disabled Person's Mobility Card and to provide information on the documents required.
